  "description" : "This is a guard that tracks down UIKit access on threads other than main. This snippet is taken from the commercial iOS PDF framework http://pspdfkit.com, but relicensed under MIT. Works because a lot of calls internally call setNeedsDisplay or setNeedsLayout. Won't catch everything, but it's very lightweight and usually does the job.",
